Git is a branch based version control system where you can work on specific features or roles without affecting the main project. This alallows developers to focus more on coding and less on cleaning up code to match with others. Additionally, it informs you of the changes that have taken place, and you can retrieve them.</p></li><li><p>git\uACFC GitHub\uC740 \uC5B4\uB5BB\uAC8C \uB2E4\uB97C\uAE4C\uC694? Git is a version control system and Github is a remote repository hub where people can upload their projects, share them, and other people can download them and contribute to them all using the GIT version control.

Clone: It is used when you &quot;copy&quot; or download code from a remote repository (such as from github) to your local computer. Add: It is used to &quot;stage&quot; your changes on your local computer before you actually commit. This means that you can choose what code goes into your commit or not. Commit: Is when you actually take a snapshot of the code that you selected using &quot;Add&quot;. Push: Is when you upload your local changes to the main remote repository so that the remote repository reflects that changes you have made locally. Pull: Pull is a combination between fetch and merge where you download the changes made into the remote repository into your local computer and fill the changes that happened remotely. Then, it merges your mhighlighted branch with the latest remote changes into a commit. Stash: it takes a screenshot of all your working directory and index so you can go back to a clean working directory.</p></li><li><p>git\uC758 Object, Commit, Head, Branch, Tag\uB294 \uC5B4\uB5A4 \uAC1C\uB150\uC77C\uAE4C\uC694? git \uC2DC\uC2A4\uD15C\uC740 \uD504\uB85C\uC81D\uD2B8\uC758 \uD788\uC2A4\uD1A0\uB9AC\uB97C \uC5B4\uB5BB\uAC8C \uC800\uC7A5\uD560\uAE4C\uC694?
